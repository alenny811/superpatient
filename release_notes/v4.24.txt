Upgrade instructions
====================

* Backup everything as usual (code and db)

* Apply db/update_db.v4.24.sql on the database.

* Copy superpatient/credentials.py.example to superpatient/credentials.py

* Edit the new credentials.py and set DB_{USER,PASS} to the respective values
  USERNAME and PASSWORD from the old superpatient/db.py

* If using the new "signature" feature, edit the new credentials.py and set
  SIGNATURE_{USER,PASS} to the credentials received from osteosoft. You must
  also communicate to them the RCCs that will be used.

* Adjust the value of DEFAULT_CANTON in customization.py based on what is in
  the old models.py.

* Adjust the new ROUNDING_MODE in customization.py if needs be.


New features
============

* Moved the credentials out of the source code.
  A template file (superpatient/credentials.py.example) is provided. It must be
  renamed and filled in with appropriate data.

* Moved DEFAULT_CANTON from models.py to customization.py as it's more logical
  to have all customization in that file.

* Thanks to osteosoft.ch, added a "signature" datamatrix to the bill as
  requested by the insurance to fight counterfeiting.
  The credentials.py file must hold the correct information for it AND
  osteosoft must know the RCC of the therapeutists for this to work.
  The feature will be disabled if any of SIGNATURE_USER, SIGNATURE_PASS or
  SIGNATURE_URL evaluate to False.

  SIGNATURE2_URL allow to get the datamatrix from a different server if it fails
  from the first server.

* Added support for rounding the total of a position in the bill to the nearest
  5 or 10 cts. By default the rounding is toward the nearest 5 cts. This can be
  disabled by setting ROUNDING_MODE to None in customization.py. An alternative
  mode that will round to the nearest 10 cts unless it's exactly a multiple of
  5 cts is available by setting it to '10cts_unless_5cts'. This later mode
  allows prices like 120.- for 45' to be defined.


Bug fixes
=========

* Reprinting the bill from bp_caisse.py whenever the payment method changed was
  broken by a previous cleanup of the bill printing interface. Fixed.

* Fixed a reference to an undefined text that would only appear when inputting
  an amount that was not a number.

* Fixed placement of the main window on macOS being behind the menu bar and thus
  impossible to grab and move.

* Fixed very old bills not being printable because they lacked a payment method.

* Fix layouting issue in the bill window on small screen.
  Thanks to Charles-Elie for contributing this fix.


Cleanups
========

* Removed old TK related stuffs from customization.py.
* Moved latest update_db*.sql with the older ones in the db directory.
