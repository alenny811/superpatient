Upgrade instructions
====================

* Backup everything as usual (code and db)

* Adjust `superpatient/customization.py` to set `COMPANY_NAME`, `ADDRESS`,
  `WEB_SITE` and `PHONE` properly. Previously these values where all in the
  variable `adresse_pog`.

* Generate the sql update script for the site using:
  `db/render_template.py db/update_db.v4.25.sql.template >db_update_site.sql`

* Apply the generated `db_update_site.sql`.


New features
============

* Added a retry mechanism to a second server for the signature.
  Contributed by lowi.

* Added an explicit db ping thread to help in keeping the db connection alive
  through NAT firewalls.

* Made more bill fields editable by default and almost all fields are editable
  when run in admin/founders mode.

* Proper logging into the `logs` directory. One file per application, rotating
  on size.

* Log SQL query execution time. This should help in understanding possible
  source of slowness.

* Added some indexes to the database to try to speedup bp_compta.py.

* Added support for multiple sites. Patients, consultations and bills are now
  tagged at creation time with the site where the creation happened. A patient
  from one site can consult at another and it's now possible to distinguish
  which consultation took place where as well as separate the bills
  accordingly. bp_compta.py exposed the site both when searching for bills and
  when computing statistics. For the time being, it's still assumed that all
  sites share the same database through the network. Next release will provide
  a way to have separate databases being synchronized to share the patients and
  consultations history.


Bug fixes
=========

* Fix usage of `os.getlogin` by using the recommended `getpass.getuser`
  instead.

* Fix LCA/LAA not properly updated based on the treatment reason.

* Fix accident date and case number not being editable until the treatment
  reason was edited again.

* Fix to properly use "Aux parents de" or "Madame/Monsieur" based on the exact
  birthdate of the patient.


Cleanups
========

* Removed all strings from superpatients/customization.py that should not require customization.
